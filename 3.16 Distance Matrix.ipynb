    "How would you as a human answer this question?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might begin by reading the articles, then you summarise their revelant points, then you compare the articles by their summaries and ultimately suggest that these two articles are \"*insert whatever adjective*\" alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how would a computer do this? A computer, or a program, might take a similar approach. For example a program might:\n",
    "* Read the articles\n",
    "* Look for patterns in the words (TF)\n",
    "* Allocate importance to the words (IDF)\n",
    "* Compare the patterns in one article to the patterns in the other\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever result the final stage ends up with, is the program's estimation of the similarity of those two articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of a distance matrix - it contains the distances, taken pairwise, between elements in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the elements in our set are the set of TF-IDF values for each article (with the set labelled as the name of the article).\n",

    "There are many ways to calculate distance, but the most simple and intuitive way we might measure this is by using Euclidean distance - *the distance of the straight line from A to B*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Subtract one point on the number line from another; the order of the subtraction doesn't matter. For example, one number is 8 and the other is -3. Subtracting 8 from -3 equals -11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the absolute value of the difference. To calculate the absolute value, square the number. For this example, -11 squared equals 121.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the square root of that number to finish calculating the absolute value. For this example, the square root of 121 is 11. The distance between the two points is 11.\n",

    "*...but our data sets contain many TF-IDF values, how do we compare the distance between those?*\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle is the same, we are finding the distance between two points, but treating each variable (word) in the data set as our *a* and *b*. So for each TF-IDF value for a word in set (article) *a*, subtract the corresponding word's TF-IDF value from set (article) *b*.\n",
    "\n",
